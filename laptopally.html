<h3>OBJECTIVE: - </h3></br>The Online Shopping is the process whereby consumers directly buy goods and services without any intermediary service over the internet. The goal of this website is to develop a web-based interface for eCommerce website, the website would be easy to use and hence the shopping experience pleasant for the users. The main goal of this website is: </br><li>To develop an easy to use web-based interface where customers can search for products, view a complete description of the product and order the product.</li><li>Reach out to a larger audience - internet access is becoming so mainstream now that your product/service can reach almost everyone on the planet with an internet-enabled device.</li><li>Your virtual shop remains open and operational 24x7 even if you/your staff are not working- this might not be wholly true if your product is a service-which requires immediate human-intervention.</li><li>In most cases; you need not maintain the whole stock of products - again this varies for different business models and will work greatly if you have a good supplier who does not defaults on supplies and a good shipping partner/team who work in sync for delivery.</li><li>You build your brand more quickly - as more people will know and talk and post and blog about you on social networks.</li><li>Once your brand is built you can diversify easily and also pull out of a certain segment if that does not work out for you with minimal losses - typical example will be Flipkart's music(tunes) store which closed off even being a great initiative.</li><li>For most part, setting up a website and maintaining it is lots cheaper given the plethora of hosting services available.</li></br>

<h3>PURPOSE: - </h3></br>With advancements in technology and with the popularity of the internet, more and more people are turning to the web for a variety of purposes. The internet is no longer limited to searching information or connecting with people but is a platform where you can also buy and sell products. An ecommerce website is a website which allows your business to sell products and services to their online audience. These days, an increasing number of consumers prefer making most of their purchases online and in such a scenario, having an ecommerce website for your business is the need of the hour. The following is a list of the top 5 reasons to have an ecommerce platform: - Wider customer reach-when you sell a product or service through a national or global platform of an ecommerce website, then you tend to reach out to a much wider audience as compared to traditional commerce methods. This gives you a broader audience and hence possibility of better overall sales. Ability to be open 24/7-with an ecommerce website, you will give your audiences to purchase from you not just during regular store hours but throughout the day. Whether it is Sunday or a national holiday, your store is always open. This too helps you to make more sales, hence boosting sales. Better conversion rates-no matter how popular your brand is, if conversion rate is low, then profits will be low. Having an ecommerce platform helps you to increase your conversion rate since people get a chance to immediately buy from you rather than wait to visit the store. Easier to set up-an ecommerce platform is definitely much easier to set up and run than an actual physical store. There are many good website development and management platforms which can easily do this task for you at reasonable rates. It is not just easier but also a lot cheaper. Reduced risk, increased profitability-to manage and run an online store, you need a smaller workforce, thus increasing margin between profits and spending. Also, there is also the advantage of reduced risk which adds to the list of the benefits of having an ecommerce store. Having an ecommerce website gives you a certain competitive edge over those who may still not have gone online. Customers these days are looking for the easiest and cheapest way to make their purchasing and thus search online for their desired products and services. In such a case, the presence of an online store not only helps you to retain existing customers but also attract new ones.</br></br>


<h3>SCOPE: - </h3></br>Nowadays, India is in a completely growing stage of development and we need to update our business to the growing needs of the new generation. There is a huge scope of eCommerce. The current generation completely belongs to e-services. Today, every business and service are going the ‘internet’ way. Everyone prefers e-services and e-governance which are the most preferred ways to connect to the people around the world. According to a report released by an American Information Technology Research & Advisory Corporation known as Garner, “e-commerce in India will probably exceed $6 Billion in profits by 2015, estimating a 70% growth from a year-ago”. Nearly 8 million people did their shopping from one of top 4 online shopping websites in 2012, and the number has grown to 35 million this year. By 2016, this online consumer base will rise to nearly 3 times to 100- million, and over 50 percent of the new buyers could be from Tier-I and Tier-II towns. This makes China one of the wildest-growing e-commerce markets in the Asia Pacific region.</br></br>

<h3>MySQL Database: -</h3></br> MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. The MySQL development project has made its source code available under the terms of the GNU General Public License, as well as under a variety of proprietary agreements. MySQL was owned and sponsored by a single for-profit firm, the Swedish company MySQL AB, now owned by Oracle Corporation. For proprietary use, several paid editions are available, and offer additional functionality. In 2010, when Oracle acquired Sun, Widenius forked the open-source MySQL project to create MariaDB. MySQL is a central component of the LAMP open-source web application software stack (and other "AMP" stacks). LAMP is an acronym for "Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python". Applications that use the MySQL database include: TYPO3, MODx, Joomla, WordPress, Simple Machines Forum, phpBB, MyBB, and Drupal. MySQL is also used in many high-profile, large-scale websites, including Google (though not for searches), Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and YouTube.</br></br>

<h3>HTML: -</h3></br> Hypertext Mark-up Language (HTML) is the standard mark-up language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a webserver or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as and introduce content into the page directly. Others such as surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page. HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript which affect the behaviour and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</br></br>

<h3>CSS: -</h3></br>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colours, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate ‘.css’ file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content. Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same mark-up page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device. The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.</br></br>

<h3>Bootstrap: -</h3></br>Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end web framework for designing websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. Unlike many web frameworks, it concerns itself with front-end development only. Bootstrap is the second most-starred project on GitHub, with more than 107,000 stars and 48,000 forks. Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden. According to twitter developer Mark Otto: “A super small group of developers and I got together to design and build a new internal tool and saw an opportunity to do something more. Through that process, we saw ourselves build something much more substantial than another internal tool. Months later, we ended up with an early version of Bootstrap as a way to document and share common design patterns and assets within the company.” After a few months of development by a small group, many developers at Twitter began to contribute to the project as a part of Hack Week, a hackathon-style week for the Twitter development team. It was renamed from Twitter Blueprint to Bootstrap, and released as an open source project on August 19, 2011. It has continued to be maintained by Mark Otto, Jacob Thornton, and a small group of core developers, as well as a large community of contributors.</br></br>
